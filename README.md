### Network Topology
Insert diagram

### The following machines were identified on the network:

- Name of VM: Hyper-V Manager (ML-REFVM-684427)
  - **Operating System**: Windows 10
  - **Purpose**: Contains the Capstone, ELK, Kali and Target Machines
  - **IP Address**: 192.168.1.1

- Name of VM: Kali 
  - **Operating System**: Linux
  - **Purpose**: Attacking Machine used for penetration test 
  - **IP Address**: 192.168.1.90 
  - **Open Ports**: 22/tcp-ssh

- Name of VM: ELK Server
  - **Operating System**: Linux 
  - **Purpose**: Elastic Search Database: It holds the Kibana Dashboards
  - **IP Address**: 192.168.1.100
  - **Open Ports**: 22/tcp-ssh and 9200/tcp-http

- Name of VM: Capstone
  - **Operating System**: Linux
  - **Purpose**: Filebeat and Metricbeat are installed and will forward logs to the Elk Machine
  - **IP Address**: 192.168.1.105
  - **Open Ports**: 22/tcp-ssh, 80/tcp-http, 422, 329, 404

- Name of VM: Target 1
  - **Operating System**: Linux 3.2 - 4.9
  - **Purpose**: Exposes a vulnerable WordPress Server
  - **IP Address**: 192.168.1.110
  - **Open Ports**:
    * 22/tcp open ssh
    * 80/tcp open http
    * 111/tcp open rpcbind
    * 139/tcp open netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3/x - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP)
    *445/tcp open netbios-ssn Samba smbd 4.2.14-Debian (workgroup: WORKGROUP)

### Description of Targets

The target of this attack was on Virtual Machine: **Target 1 IP Address 192.168.1.110**

**Target 1** is an Apache web server and has SSH enabled, so ports 80 and 22 are possible ports of entry for attackers. As such, the following alerts have been implemented:

### Monitoring the Targets

Traffic to these services should be carefully monitored. To this end, we have implemented the alerts below:

### Name of Alert 1: Excessive HTTP Errors

Alert 1 is implemented as follows:
  - **Metric**: Packetbeat ('http.response.status_code')
  - **Threshold**: WHEN count() GROUPED OVER top 5 'http.response.status_code' IS ABOVE 400 FOR THE LAST 5 minutes
  - **Vulnerability Mitigated**: Brute Force Attacks 
  - **Reliability**: This Alert is High Reliability because it will reduce the number of false positives and alert when a high number of HTTP Error's are present after 5 minutes

### Name of Alert 2: HTTP Response Size Monitor

Alert 2 is implemented as follows:
  - **Metric**: Packetbeat (http.request.bytes)
  - **Threshold**: WHEN sum() of http.request.bytes OVER all documents IS ABOVE 3500 FOR THE LAST 1 minute
  - **Vulnerability Mitigated**: Code Injection attacks (XSS or CRLF)
  - **Reliability**: This is Medium Reliability because some it may generate false positives. There is the possibility that a large, non-malicious HTTP request may trigger the alarm.

#### Name of Alert 3: CPU Usage Monitor

Alert 3 is implemented as follows:
  - **Metric**: Metricbeat (system.process.cpu.total.pct) 
  - **Threshold**: WHEN max() OF system.process.cpu.total.pct OVER all documents IS ABOVE 0.5 FOR THE LAST 5 minutes
  - **Vulnerability Mitigated**: Virus or Malware
  - **Reliability**: This is Low Reliability because this alert will generate a lot of false positives. CPU can spike for several different reasons.
